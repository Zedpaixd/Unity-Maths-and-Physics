Each weapon is seperated to individual animatable parts, with acrruate placing of pivots for each part for easy animation. 
We've also included empty GameOjects to indicate the Barrel Location (Barrel_Location) and Casing Exit location (Ejection_Location).


-- Shootable "Plug and Play" Weapons --

This version includes a "Plug & Play" prefab for each weapon, search for the prefab with (Shooting) in the name. 
To make adjustments to the shooting script, please note that the callbacks for the Shoot() and CasingRelease() functions are in the animations themselves as animation events.

We've included the demo scene as featured in the preview images of the package for your pleasure and use.
To fully utulize this scene, it is recommended to install the "Post Processing Stack v2" asset and the "Cinemachine" Asset from the Package Manager.
Demo scene also uses a custom Volumetric Light plugin, which you can more info about in the "_Demo Assets" Folder.
